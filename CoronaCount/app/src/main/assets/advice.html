      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">1. Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h5>
        <p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for <b>at least 20 seconds</b>. Work the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails.
<br>
You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap. Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything including your phone or laptop.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">2. Avoid touching your face</h5>
        <p>SARS-CoV-2 can live on hard surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface like a doorknob, gas pump handle, or your cell phone.
<br>
Avoid touching any part of your face or head including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">3. Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now</h5>
<p>Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin to skin contact can pass SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">4. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</h5>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by air droplets to other people when you cough or sneeze. It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days.
<br>
<b>Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow</b> to keep your hands as clean as possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">5. Clean and disinfect surfaces</h5>
<p>Use alcohol-based disinfectants to clean hard surfaces in your home like countertops, door handles, furniture, and toys. Also clean your phone, laptop, and anything else you use regularly several times a day.
<br>
Disinfect areas after you bring groceries or packages into your home. Use white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide solutions for general cleaning in between disinfecting surfaces.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">6. Take social distancing seriously</h5>
        <p>If you are carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it will be found in high amounts in your spit (sputum). This can happen even if you do not have symptoms.
<br>
Social distancing means staying home and working remotely when possible. If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet from other people. You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you.</p>

    <div class="media-body">
      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">7. Do not gather in groups</h5>
        <p>Being in a group or gathering makes it more likely that you will be in close contact with someone. This includes avoiding all religious places of worship, as you may have to sit or stand too close to another congregant. It also includes congregating at parks or beaches.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">8. Avoid eating or drinking in public places</h5>
        <p>Now is not the time to go out to eat. This means avoiding restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other eateries. The virus can be transmitted through food, utensils, dishes, and cups. It may also be airborne from other people in the venue.
<br>
You can still get delivery or takeaway food. Choose foods that are thoroughly cooked and can be reheated. High heat (at least 132°F/56°C, according to one recent, not-yet-peer-reviewed lab study) helps to kill coronaviruses. This means it may be best to <b>avoid cold foods</b> from restaurants and all food from buffets and open salad bars.</p>

        <p>Soak all raw, whole fruits and vegetables in a solution of food-grade hydrogen peroxide or white vinegar. Let dry before putting them away in your fridge and cupboards. You can also use vegetable antibacterial wash to clean produce. Wash your hands before and after handling fresh produce</p>

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">10. Wear a (homemade) mask</h5>
        <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <b>(CDC)</b> recommendsTrusted Source that almost everyone wear a cloth face mask in public settings where social distancing may be difficult, such as grocery stores.
        <br>
            The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">CDC’s website</a> provides instructionsTrusted Source for making your own mask at home, using basic materials such as a T-shirt and scissors.
            <br>
        Some pointers to keep in mind:
            <ul>
        <li>Wearing a mask alone will not prevent you from getting a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Careful handwashing and social (physical) distancing must also be followed.</li>
                <li>Cloth masks aren’t as effective as other types of masks, such as surgical masks or N95 respirators. However, these other masks should be reserved for healthcare workers.</li>
                <li>Wash your hands before you put on your mask.</li>
                <li>
                A mask shouldn’t be worn by a child under 2 years old, a person who has trouble breathing, or a person who can’t remove the mask on their own.
                </li>
                
        </ul>

    <div class="media-body">
      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">12. Self-quarantine if sick</h5>
        <p>Call your doctor if you have any symptoms. Stay home until you recover. Avoid sitting, sleeping, or eating with your loved ones even if you live in the same home.
<br>
Wear a mask and wash your hands as much as possible. If you need urgent medical care, wear a mask and let them know you may have COVID-19.
